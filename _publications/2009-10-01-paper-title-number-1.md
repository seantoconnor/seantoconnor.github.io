Do women pay more than men in the housing market? We utilize repeat-sales
housing data from ZTRAX to examine if gender gaps exist in house purchase prices
and loan-to-price ratios. We find that female homebuyers pay a 2% premium on
average. In addition, female homebuyers' loan to price ratio is 3 percentage
points lower than that of male buyers. We also show that female buyers pay
less when the seller is female than when the seller is male. However, the
gender price differentials and loan-to-price differentials are disappearing
in more recent years. One possible explanation for the disappearing gender
price differentials in house prices and loan-to-price ratios is the shrinking
of the gender wage gap in recent years.
