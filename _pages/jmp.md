# Climate Adaptation in Non-Market Activities: The North-South Gap

This research examines the role of non-market behavioral adaptation to climate change in the United States with a novel estimation procedure that accounts for both short-run weather and long-run climate adjustments. First, I comprehensively review the temperature sensitivity of all activities in the American Time Use Survey using a ﬂexible non-linear estimation procedure. Most activities are found to be unresponsive to temperature with the exception of those that take place outdoors. These sensitive outdoor activities are studied further using the Climate Adaptation Response Estimation approach, which allows for temperature responses to vary geographically. The sensitivity to temperature varies across the country, and this variation is especially pronounced for cold-weather cities in which inhabitants reduce their outdoor and physical activities at extreme temperatures relative to warm-weather cities. Finally I simulate the expected change in outdoor activity time using climate models compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ﬁnding a large increase in outdoor time driven by warmer winters.
