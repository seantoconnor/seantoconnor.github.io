## [The Willingness to Pay for a Cooler Day: Evidence from 50 Years of Major League Baseball](http://seantoconnor.github.io/files/Baseball.pdf)
with Melissa LoPalo and Kevin Kuruc.\\
**American Economic Journal: Applied Economics 17(1): 126-59**

The climate economy literature has documented adverse effects of extreme temperatures on well-being through mechanisms such as mortality, productivity, and conflict. Impacts due simply to discomfort are less well understood. This paper investigates individualsâ€™ valuations of weather using a revealed preference approach. We first quantify the decline in attendance at Major League Baseball games on hot and cold days. Leveraging this finding coupled with the historically informed assumption of a horizontal supply curve, we infer a monetized estimate of the disutility of extreme temperatures. We estimate a $1.53 utility loss per hour of exposure to high temperatures, implying
nontrivial aggregate welfare effects.


## I am Jane. Do I Pay More in the Housing Market?
with Myongjin Kim, Leilei Shen, and Brent Norwood.\\
**Economic Bulletin**, AccessEcon, vol. 39(2), pages 1612-1620.

Do women pay more than men in the housing market? We utilize repeat-sales
housing data from ZTRAX to examine if gender gaps exist in house purchase prices
and loan-to-price ratios. We find that female homebuyers pay a 2% premium on
average. In addition, female homebuyers' loan to price ratio is 3 percentage
points lower than that of male buyers. We also show that female buyers pay
less when the seller is female than when the seller is male. However, the
gender price differentials and loan-to-price differentials are disappearing
in more recent years. One possible explanation for the disappearing gender
price differentials in house prices and loan-to-price ratios is the shrinking
of the gender wage gap in recent years.
