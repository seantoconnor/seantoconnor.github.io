## I am Jane. Do I Pay More in the Housing Market?
with Myongjin Kim, Leilei, and Brent Norwood.
**Economic Bulletin**, AccessEcon, vol. 39(2), pages 1612-1620.

Do women pay more than men in the housing market? We utilize repeat-sales
housing data from ZTRAX to examine if gender gaps exist in house purchase prices
and loan-to-price ratios. We find that female homebuyers pay a 2% premium on
average. In addition, female homebuyers' loan to price ratio is 3 percentage
points lower than that of male buyers. We also show that female buyers pay
less when the seller is female than when the seller is male. However, the
gender price differentials and loan-to-price differentials are disappearing
in more recent years. One possible explanation for the disappearing gender
price differentials in house prices and loan-to-price ratios is the shrinking
of the gender wage gap in recent years.

# Working Papers
## Retail Marijuana Deregulation and Housing Prices
with Donggeun Kim and Brent Norwood, 2019.

Despite federal law, ten American states and Washington D.C. have legalized
recreational marijuana since 2012. Using a national housing data set from the
online real estate listing database Zillow.com, we identify the cross and
inter-state effects of marijuana legalization on house prices in different
points of the price distribution function. We find positive effects upwards
of fifteen percent in the bottom half of the price distribution following
successful legalization ballot initiatives, and twenty percent in the top half
of the distribution after the state enacts the ballot initiative and the first
legal sales take place. Within Colorado, the introduction of dispensaries to a
neighborhood similarly results in a five percent price appreciation when
dispensaries open nearby. Considered together, this research suggests that
there are second order benefits associated with marijuana legalization that
policy makers and voters should be aware of when deciding the drug's legal
status.
