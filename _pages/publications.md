## I am Jane. Do I Pay More in the Housing Market?
with Myongjin Kim, Leilei Shen, and Brent Norwood.
**Economic Bulletin**, AccessEcon, vol. 39(2), pages 1612-1620.

Do women pay more than men in the housing market? We utilize repeat-sales
housing data from ZTRAX to examine if gender gaps exist in house purchase prices
and loan-to-price ratios. We find that female homebuyers pay a 2% premium on
average. In addition, female homebuyers' loan to price ratio is 3 percentage
points lower than that of male buyers. We also show that female buyers pay
less when the seller is female than when the seller is male. However, the
gender price differentials and loan-to-price differentials are disappearing
in more recent years. One possible explanation for the disappearing gender
price differentials in house prices and loan-to-price ratios is the shrinking
of the gender wage gap in recent years.

## Retail Marijuana Deregulation and Housing Prices
with Donggeun Kim and Brent Norwood, 2020.

Despite federal law, twelve American states and Washington D.C. have legalized recreational marijuana since 2012. Using a national housing data set from the online real estate listing database Zillow.com, we identify the cross and inter-state effects of marijuana legalization on house prices in different points of the price distribution function. We find positive effects upwards of ten percent in the top half of the price distribution following successful legalization ballot initiatives, and between five and fifteen percent across the distribution after the state enacts the ballot initiative and the first legal sales take place. A spatial difference-in-differences model reveals that within Colorado and Washington, prices in neighborhoods with new dispensary openings nearby experience a seven percent price appreciation. To summarize, our results suggest that there are second order benefits to marijuana legalization
