I'm an Economist at the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). I specialize in risk management, especially with respect to climate change.

More specifically, I'm interested in the climate change adaptation and the implications of Americans' willingness to pay for environmental goods. I've also studied topics involving the housing market in the United States, ranging from the effect of marijuana legalization to airline bankruptcies.
