I am a Ph.D. Economist specializing in climate risk, behavioral economics, and financial modeling. My work is focused on answering one of the most critical questions of our time: How do we measure and manage the financial risks of a changing climate?

My academic research developed new ways to quantify non-market climate risks and model how human behavior adapts to our changing environment. As a Senior Economist at the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), I have applied this expertise in a regulatory setting, leading the development of forward-looking climate scenarios and analyzing the climate risk exposure of P&C insurance companies. This work has given me direct, hands-on experience connecting physical climate hazards to insurer solvency and the stability of our financial system. My background combines rigorous econometric modeling in Python and R with a practical understanding of regulatory policy, and I hold a certification in the Financial Analysis of Insurance Companies.

I am passionate about using data to help organizations navigate the complex intersection of climate change, economic shifts, and financial stability, building more resilient strategies for the future.
