I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Oklahoma's economics
department. My fields of study are environmental economics, development
economics, and industrial organization.

More specifically, I'm interested in the climate change adaptaion and the implications of Americans' willingness to pay for environmental goods. I've also studied topics involving the housing market in the United States, ranging from the effect of marijuana legalization
to airline bankruptcies.

Outside of research I'm a massive Boston Celtics and Liverpool F.C. fan. I also
really enjoy cooking and photography. A sample of pictures from a  few recent
trips to Abu Dhabi, Boston, and Washington can be seen below.
