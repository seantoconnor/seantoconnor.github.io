I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Oklahoma's economics
department. My fields of study are environmental economics, development
economics, and industrial organization.

More specifically, I'm interested in the ability of fishing firms and fishermen
to adapt to climate change and weather events. The world's oceans are highly
vulnerable to the effects of climate change and generally have been understudied
in the research literature. I've also studied topics involving the housing
market in the United States, ranging from the effect of marijuana legalization
to airline bankruptcies.

Outside of research I'm a massive Boston Celtics and Liverpool F.C. fan. I also
really enjoy cooking and photography. A sample of pictures from a  few recent
trips to Abu Dhabi, Boston, and Washington can be seen below.
